This project aims to build an efficient AI model for classifying SMS messages as either spam or legitimate. Leveraging state-of-the-art techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and powerful classifiers including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), we have successfully developed a robust spam detection system. Through extensive experimentation, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier emerged with high accuracy, showcasing its effectiveness in discerning between spam and legitimate messages. The model was trained on a diverse dataset, and the features were extracted using TF-IDF to capture the importance of words in distinguishing between spam and non-spam texts. This repository not only provides the trained model and codebase but also offers insights into the methodology employed. Feel free to explore, contribute, and utilize this project for enhancing SMS security and filtering unwanted messages #CodSOFT @CodSoft
